# Choosing-best-Machine-Learning-algorithm-for-prediction

Please read the Choosing-best-Machine-Learning-algorithm-for-prediction.ipynb file for the code 
The file explores multiple machine learning algorithms like Logistics Regression, Support Vector Machines, Multi-layer Perceptron, Random Forest and Boosting by creating models and training them on Titanic dataset from Kaggle
The file also Computes accuracy, precision and recall of each model and compared them to select the best model for the Titanic dataset.
